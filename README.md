# cse237-project

Project Description
We are creating an executable program that will return data about the stock market or a specific ticker. By prompting the user to input a ticker and some data they are interested in finding out, we will be able to return that data. With the vested interested in the stock interest amongst young people recently, we hope that this program will be able to print out data in a digestible format and be easy for new traders to understand.
